 * Resolves plugin option types based on the full context.

 *
 * Plugins extend PluginResolvers via declaration merging to add their own
 * resolved option types.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // In your plugin's types.ts:
 * declare module "@spoosh/core" {
 *   interface PluginResolvers<TContext> {
 *     myOption: MyResolvedType<TContext["data"]> | undefined;

 * type ResolvedOptions = ResolveTypes<
 *   MergePluginOptions<TPlugins>["read"],

 *     schema: ApiSchema;

 *     error: Error;
